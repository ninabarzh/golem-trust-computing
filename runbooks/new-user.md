# Runbook: New user account created

## What to do

1. Check who created the account (should be in audit logs)
2. Verify this was intentional (ask in #general Slack)
3. If nobody knows about it: [COMPROMISED SERVER](compromised-server.md), follow that runbook
4. If it's legitimate: update the access matrix document
